<h2>About me</h2>

I am a graduate student of Mechanical Engineering with a Computer Science Minor. I have a passion for Robotics and Machine Learning and have been in its learning process for years. My interest in programming was born in my high school, when I started to interact with computer on a daily basis, giving me command over languages like Java and Visual Basic.In addition to my coursework, I continued to work on my skills, and used Android Studio for making some basic applications.
<br><br>
My background in both mechanical engineering and computer science has given him a unique perspective on the intersection of the two fields and how they can be used together to create innovative solutions.
<br><br>
I am particularly interested in using my programming skills to develop intelligent systems that can interact with the physical world, such as robots that can navigate and perform tasks autonomously. He is excited about the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence to revolutionize industries and create new opportunities for innovation.
